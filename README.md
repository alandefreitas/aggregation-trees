## Generating an Aggregation Tree

Loading the data for the example:

```MATLAB
load example_data;
```

Usual parallel coordinate plot with clusters to facilitate visualization:

```MATLAB
figure(3);
tradeoff(obj);
```

Aggregation Trees with Polar Graph (polar graph with clusters to facilitate visualization):

```MATLAB
figure(1);
AT(obj);
```

## Syntax 

The function ``AT`` has the following syntax:

```MATLAB
function [ t, obj_order ] = AT( Points, minimization, normalization )
```

The function generates an ***Aggregation Tree*** for the points in the variable:
 
 * `Points`. The variable `Points` has a row for each point and a column for each objective. 
 * `Minimization` is `1` for minimization and `0` for maximization (it can be a vector)

The file `example_data.mat` contains a set of data points that can be used for tests:

```matlab
load example_data;
```

The package also includes a function for generating parallel coordinates:

```matlab
tradeoff(obj);
```

The Aggregation Tree (with Polar Graph) can be generated with:

```matlab
AT(obj);
```
